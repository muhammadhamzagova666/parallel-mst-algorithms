# parallel-mst-algorithms
A comprehensive project implementing and evaluating parallel versions of Boruvka's and Kruskal's algorithms for computing minimum spanning trees (MST) on weighted graphs using OpenMP and MPI. This repository provides insights into performance, scalability, and design choices for both sequential and parallel graph algorithms.
